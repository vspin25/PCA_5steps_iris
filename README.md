PCA in 5 steps

In this work we will explain the algebra steps of PCA applied to iris data set. In general what it is done is to reduce the dimensions of the original data set (150x4) to a dimension of (150x3), but this is not done arbitrary. We must select the component with less significance to discriminate.
